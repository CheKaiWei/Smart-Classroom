## Introduction 简介
With the rapid development of the Internet of things technology, new educational technology means are emerging, and the teaching mode is changing. It is gradually changing from the teacher's propaganda to the interaction between teaching and learning, from the teacher's propaganda to the interaction between teaching and learning. There are many problems in traditional education and teaching that are hard to solve for a long time. In order to create an intelligent, efficient and intelligent classroom teaching environment and promote the personalized growth and intelligent development of students, this project adopts the Internet of things technology to develop a set of Internet of things intelligent classroom systems based on o2o mode.

This system includes an interactive intelligent projection system and a global cloud teaching system. Among them, the interactive intelligent projection system is mainly composed of computers, wireless electronic pen, camera, projector, and projection cloth; the global cloud teaching system is mainly composed of tablets, Web terminal, database, and terminal.

In the interactive intelligent projection system, teachers can write on the projection cloth by using a wireless electronic pen, or operate ppt directly, or even control the computer wirelessly. In order to realize the functions of wireless electronic brush and wireless control computer, this work combines machine vision and image recognition technology, Bluetooth communication technology, Windows API technology, and other technologies, and independently produces the wireless electronic pen mainly developed by Arduino nano development board and the Bluetooth module radio pen equipped with cc2540 chip, and develops the recognition algorithm of wireless electronic pen based on OpenCV.

The global cloud teaching system provides students with network cloud courses, real-time interactive communication platform, and multimedia cloud notes. Among them, online cloud courses can be provided to students in the form of live broadcast or recorded broadcast; the real-time interactive communication platform is mainly to create a learning-oriented chat environment for teachers and students to enhance the interaction between students and teachers and students; multimedia cloud notes is a new form of notes that integrates video, audio, text notes, and students can use the handwritten board and other ways quickly Efficiently create multimedia cloud notes, and share notes through the Internet. In order to achieve the above functions, this work makes use of real-time information communication technology and other technologies, and independently makes a handwritten board mainly composed of beaglebone black development board and lcd07 touch screen, and builds alicloud server based on Apache network environment.

This work is easy to operate, with complete functions, intelligence, and low cost. No matter for teachers or students, this work can greatly make their teaching or education easier. Under the background of the Internet of things era, the innovation of teaching mode has great market application and promotion value.

随着物联网技术的快速发展，新的教育技术手段不断涌现，教学模式也在不断发生变化，逐渐从教师的宣讲向教与学的互动方面转变，从教师的宣讲向教与学的互动方面转变。传统教育教学中长期存在和难以解决的诸多问题，为打造智能高效、富有智慧的课堂教学环境，促进学生个性化成长和智慧发展，本项目采用物联网技术，开发了一套基于O2O模式的物联网智能课堂系统。

本系统包括交互式智能投影系统和Global云教学系统两个系统。其中，交互式智能投影系统主要由电脑、无线电子笔、摄像头、投影仪、投影布组成；Global云教学系统主要由手写板、Web端、数据库、终端组成。

在交互式智能投影系统中，老师可通过利用无线电子笔，在投影布上进行板书，或者对PPT进行直接操作、甚至是对电脑进行无线操控等。为实现无线电子画笔和无线操控电脑的功能，本作品结合了机器视觉和图像识别技术、蓝牙通讯技术、Windows api技术等技术，自主制作了主要由Arduino Nano开发板和搭载CC2540芯片的蓝牙模块无线电子笔，研发了基于opencv的无线电子笔的识别算法等。

Global云教学系统为学生提供了网络云课程、实时互动交流平台和多媒体云笔记等。其中，网络云课程可通过直播或者录播的形式提供给学生使用；实时互动交流平台主要为老师和学生营造一个以学习为目的的聊天环境，以增强学生间和师生间的互动能力；多媒体云笔记是一种集视频、音频、文字备注的新格式笔记，学生可通过手写板等方式快捷高效的制作多媒体云笔记，并可通过互联网实现笔记的共享。为实现以上功能，本作品利用了实时信息通讯技术等技术，自主制作了主要是由BeagleBone Black开发板和LCD07触控屏组成的手写板，搭建了基于Apache网络环境的阿里云服务器等。

本作品操作方便，功能齐全智能且成本较低。无论是对老师还是对学生，本作品都能够极大地使他们的教学或者接受教育变得更加轻松，在物联网的时代背景下的进行了教学模式的创新，具有较大的市场应用和推广价值。

## Project Purpose 项目目的
The basic idea of this project is to add more hardware and software elements to the traditional multimedia equipment with projector and computer as the core to build an intelligent classroom system. Hardware adds devices such as cameras, tablets, and wireless pens. In this way, teachers can express their teaching contents in the classroom as much as possible, and students can accept the teaching contents as much as possible; in the aspect of the software, the classroom is connected with the Internet, so as to add another online classroom on the basis of the original school classroom and present the content of the school classroom offline again, so that students can really be in the classroom Review the knowledge that you missed or didn't understand in class. The purpose of this project is to build a multi-resource and multi-element intelligent classroom system that integrates offline classroom teacher's teaching content and recreates online classroom content.

This project first adds a camera above the projector. When the teacher uses the wireless electronic pen for blackboard writing against the projection cloth in class, the camera can capture the teacher's writing track, and after a series of processing, the projector can project the teacher's handwriting in real-time. At this point, there is no ink on the projection cloth. The wireless pen is like a real pen writing on the projection cloth and leaving traces. At the same time, the courseware with handwriting will be sent to each student's tablet to take notes.

Students can use the tablet on the desk to set the time node where they think it is important at any time, and finally generate a multi-element note with video, voice and text notes. At the same time, teachers use the tablet to ask students questions at any time. Students only need to answer on the tablet to show the answer process on the projection screen. This function can greatly facilitate teachers to acquire students' knowledge.

With the functions of video recording and live broadcasting, the teacher's classroom content can be recorded and uploaded to the corresponding web end to form a live video form for students to use. At the same time, the live video can also be saved. After class, the video playback end can be reproduced for students to watch. The chat room is designed to make students better communicate and learn after class. Teachers can also learn about students' learning and their evaluation of the classroom in the chat room.

本项目的基本思路是在以投影仪和电脑为核心的传统多媒体设备增添更加多的软硬件元素，打造一个智能课堂系统。硬件添加如摄像头、手写板和无线电子笔等设备。如此使得老师能够在课堂上尽可能地表达自己的教学内容和让学生能够最大限度地去接受老师授课的内容；软件方面则是将课堂与互联网联通，使得在原本的学校课堂的基础上增添多一个线上课堂，将学校课堂的内容再次呈现在线下，使得学生能够真正地能够在课堂下复习到自己上课遗漏或者不解的知识点。本项目旨在打造一个集线下课堂老师授课内容，线上重现上课内容的多资源多元素的智能课堂系统。

本项目首先在投影仪上方添加一个摄像头。老师在课上对着投影布使用无线电子笔进行板书时，摄像头能够捕捉获取到老师的书写轨迹，并经过一系列处理让投影仪实时地投影出老师的笔迹。此时，投影布上并没有墨水。无线电子笔就好像一支真实的笔在投影布上书写同时留下痕迹。同时，带有笔迹的课件会相应地被发送至每位学生的手写板当中供他们做笔记。

学生可使用课桌上的手写板随时将他认为重要的地方设置时间节点，最后在生成一个具备视频、语音、文字备注的多元素笔记。同时老师利用手写板随时提问学生，学生只需在手写板上作答即可将解答过程呈投影屏上，该功能能够极大地方便教师获取学生对知识的掌握情况。

利用录屏和直播的功能，能够将老师课堂的内容录下来并上传到相应的web端上形成一个直播视频形式供学生们使用，同时直播的视频会也可以保存，课下可再现视频播放端，供学生们观看。聊天室是为了能够让学生更加好地在课后交流学习而打造的，老师也能够在聊天室中了解到学生的学习情况和他们对课堂的评价情况。
